### What's the goal?

We need to reach as many voters as possible to inform them that the election is happening,
who the Democrat candidates are, and what's at stake. Direct contact puts a human face/voice to the process of voting and to
the issues. All these methods have been proven to work to turn out more voters.

### Who do we call?

Democrats! Different campaigns target different groups at different times. A common example of the group that
is targeted is registered Democrats who are unlikely to vote. Campaigns can request voting records of
when people voted (but not who they voted for of course)! Weird, I know. So, these people are likely to vote for
Democrats if they do vote, but are also likely to not vote. So if we help them get out and vote, it's a good
investment of effort!

### Everyone already knows about the election and has made up their minds right? What's the point of calling people?

Yes, probably everyone we call is aware of the election, and already know who they will vote for if they vote.

But many people don't have what we call in canvassing "a plan". If they are going to vote in person, they
might not know where to vote, what time the polling location is open, might not have a plan for when to vote (before vs. after work, etc).

Some people feel pretty sure they will vote, but when election day comes around they might get lazy,
assume their vote isn't that consequential, etc.

We call them to give them information and encouragement. This is proven to turn out more voters!

### Even if we can flip a handful of voters, isn't that a drop in the bucket compared to who is already voting?

Short answer: Every vote counts! The entire VA legislature was lost to Republicans by ONE VOTE in 2017! üò¢

Long answer: All those drops in the bucket add up! When we canvass, do phone calls, or text, we are reaching out to voters
and gaining some votes, and we are also collecting data for the campaign to use later for various purposes, such as
deciding whom to reach out to via phone on election day to remind them to vote.

Another answer: This year the GOTV effort is massive and we are going to change outcomes. JOIN US!

* lol ~~Canvassing: Walk door to door, inform people about the election and the candidate. You meet a spectrum of Americans and make a difference ‚Äî it's fun! There is very little confrontation, and many people are grateful to have a face-to-face conversation with someone who cares. It's really life-changing and productive. The campaign has different goals for the canvass day-to-day. You will get a quick training and you will be partnered with an experienced person.~~
